 *
 * This is SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number
 * generator(SFMT) with jump function.
 *
 * This Project provides jump function of SFMT.
 *
 * We are very sorry but we don't support either BIG ENDIAN or altivec
 * in this version.
 *
 * There are two steps for jumpping.
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Calculate jump polynomial using characteristic polynomial.
 *   <ul>
 *    <li>\b calc-jump executable file calculates a jump polynomial.
 *    <li>\b calc-jump is written in C++ language and needs NTL for compile.
 *    <li> Additionally, users can call
 *     sfmt::calc_jump(std::string& jump_str, NTL::ZZ& step,
 *     NTL::GF2X& characteristic) in SFMT-calc-jump.hpp from their
 *     programs.
 *    <li> jump steps used above is based on internal state,
 *     i.e, 32-bit integers are skipped 4 * jump steps, and 64-bit
 *     integers are skipped 2 * jump steps.
 *   </ul>
 *  <li> Change internal state of SFMT into jumpped state.
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>\b SFMT_jump(sfmt_t * sfmt, const char * jump_str)
 *         changes internal state of \b sfmt in user's programs.
 *     <li> @see sample1.c sample2.c
 *   </ul>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Caution:
 *   The jump polynomial calculated using a characteristic polynomial
 * is only available for jumpping SFMT states which has the
 * characteristic polynomial.
